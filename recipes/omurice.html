<<h2> Description</h2>
<p> Omurice is something that does not look appetizing to me but I have such a love for japanese culture and food so I definitely wanted to add this classic to our list.
  </p>

<p> This is also one I have never cooked and do not see myself cooking anytime soon but again it's love! </p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li> 2 tbsp butter </li>
  <li> 1/2 medium onion, cut in 1/2 inch dice (about 3/4 a cup)</li>
  <li>  medium carrot </li>
  <li> soy sauce </li>

  <li> Ok I need to figure out a faster way to do these lists. <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019430-omurice-japanese-rice-omelet"> Heres the full recipe></a> </li>




</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>

  <li>Make the rice: Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Add 1 tablespoon butter, and then onion and carrot. Cook, stirring, until onion is translucent and a little browned at the edges, about 3 minutes. Add ham and cook, stirring, until it begins to brown, about 30 seconds.

</li>
  <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter, and then rice, breaking it up with a wooden spoon or long chopsticks. Adjust heat to medium and cook until the grains are glossy, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in ketchup and soy sauce, and cook, stirring, another 30 seconds or so to caramelize. Stir in peas to heat through, and deglaze the pan with dashi or chicken stock. Remove from heat and season to taste with salt and pepper. </li>
  <li> To make a perfect mound of rice on each plate, grease a small bowl with canola or safflower oil and pack 1 cup of the rice. Invert this over a plate and remove the bowl. Repeat with the other half of the rice on a second plate.</li>
  <li>A few more steps need to be listed but we get the gist of the project  </li>
